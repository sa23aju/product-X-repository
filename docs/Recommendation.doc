Recommendation 1: Implement Transparent Pricing and Promotional Compliance
Priority: CRITICAL
Issue Identified
The interface displays “Sale! 40% OFF Today” while maintaining the same $299.00 price point without showing the original price or discount calculation. This creates significant legal and ethical concerns.
Justification
Legal Factors: This type of presentation runs afoul of consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions. Deceptive pricing under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPUT) in the UK and the US Federal Trade Commission Act are laws which seek to protect consumers from misleading prices. If you're a retailer, you must actually offer better prices than your references. Misleading or unprovable sale representations are illegal commercial practices that can lead to enforcement action, hefty penalties, and lawsuits. The current approach has the organization at legal risk due to regulatory fines and class-action litigation.
Ethical Factors: Transparent pricing is a basic moral responsibility to consumers. Fake sales signs employ psychological prices techniques that deceive the consumers’ selection predisposition and fail any test on honest trading and fair-dealing. This activity undermines consumer confidence and goes against the ethical principles of business as set out by professional organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Marketing. Good commercial conduct consists in the fact that advertising must be true, verifiable and not deceive.
Professional Factors: Professionally speaking, this is a poor QA assignment and lack of compliance oversight. In e-commerce development you either validate your pricing logic very thoroughly (especially if you want to promote the product) or not at all. This discrepancy is the result of either a technical malfunction in the pricing infrastructure or willful disinformation; in either case it’s an indictment to human performance. Best practise in the sector would require a validation step as part of any promotional pricing systems to avoid such discrepancies.
Commercial Factors: From a business standpoint, this issue poses a serious reputational risk. In e-commerce, customer trust is everything and nothing erodes that trust faster than misleading pricing. Once customers feel deceived, you start seeing negative reviews, social media criticism, and a weakened brand image, all of which hurt conversion rates and long-term customer loyalty.
There’s also the possibility of regulators stepping in, which can lead to forced refunds, mandatory corrective advertising, and lasting damage to your position in the market. Compared to those consequences, the cost of fixing this problem now is small. Addressing it proactively is far cheaper and far safer than dealing with the fallout of unhappy customers or regulatory action later.

Recommendation 2: Remove or Clarify the “Hidden Configuration ID” Field
Priority: HIGH
Issue Identified
The product configuration interface includes a user-facing field labeled “Hidden Configuration ID,” which is contradictory and potentially concerning from security and user experience perspectives.
Justification
Legal Factors: Using the word “hidden” in a customer-facing interface can raise red flags around data protection and privacy laws like the GDPR and similar rules in other countries. If this field collects or uses any personal data, customers have a legal right to know what information is being gathered and why.
The unclear wording could even fall short of GDPR’s transparency requirements under Article 13, which requires companies to explain data-processing activities in plain, understandable terms. And if this configuration ID is being used for device tracking or profiling, then you’re legally required to get explicit consent from users.
Ethical Factors: When it comes to personal health monitoring devices, transparency in the user interface isn’t just good practice it’s an ethical obligation. Using a term like “hidden” implies something is being concealed, which goes against the principles of informed consent and user control. People who buy health-tracking products expect a high level of clarity about how their data is used.
From an ethical standpoint, companies should clearly explain every aspect of data collection, processing, and configuration in straightforward, accessible language. The goal should be to empower users, not leave them confused or unsure about what’s happening with their information.
Professional Factors: From a professional UX/UI perspective, this is a major usability issue. Calling something a “hidden” field while still showing it to users creates confusion why would something labeled “hidden” be visible at all? Good interface design relies on clarity, consistency, and helping users immediately understand what they’re looking at.
This kind of label usually comes from internal technical terminology that accidentally made its way into the customer-facing interface, which suggests a breakdown between backend development and frontend design. In a well-run product process, every element that appears in the UI should be reviewed to make sure it’s understandable, intentional, and appropriate for users.
Commercial Factors: From a commercial standpoint, confusing users has a direct cost. When interface elements are unclear, people have to think harder, which slows them down, creates hesitation, and can lead them to abandon a purchase altogether. It also drives up customer support requests, which adds operational strain. In a competitive e-commerce space, even small moments of friction can lower conversion rates.
If customers see a term like “hidden,” they may assume something shady or privacy-related is going on, which can create negative feelings about the brand—feelings that are hard to undo. Clear, intuitive settings help build trust, boost user confidence, and ultimately increase the likelihood that customers complete their purchases.

Recommendation 3: Replace Unavailable Video Content with Functional Product Demonstrations
**Priority: HIGH
Issue Identified
The product demonstration section displays “Video unavailable” rather than functional content, significantly undermining the website’s credibility and effectiveness.
Justification
Legal Factors: Even though product videos aren’t regulated as strictly as pricing, they still fall under consumer protection rules. Companies are expected to give shoppers clear and accurate information so they can make informed decisions. When a product video is missing or unavailable, it can signal that the product details are incomplete or that the website isn’t being properly maintained.
In some cases, that absence can even be problematic legally. If the video is mentioned in marketing materials or forms part of the product description, not providing it could be seen as misleading by leaving out important information.
Ethical Factors: From an ethical standpoint, companies have a responsibility to give customers complete and accurate product information especially when the product involves health monitoring and could influence someone’s well-being. When a product video is missing, it can come across as either poor website maintenance or a rushed product launch before all the materials were ready. In both cases, it suggests a lack of attention to the standards expected in ethical commerce.
Customers looking to buy health-related technology deserve clear, thorough information so they can make confident, informed decisions about their health.
Professional Factors: From a professional perspective, this is a simple quality control failure. Having broken or missing content on a live e-commerce site usually means the testing or deployment process wasn’t thorough enough, or that the content management system isn’t being properly maintained. In professional web development, teams are expected to thoroughly test everything before launch and continuously monitor the site to catch issues quickly.
When elements on the site don’t work, it points to deeper problems in the quality assurance process and ultimately makes the organization look less reliable and less professional.
Commercial Factors: Product demonstration videos are critical conversion tools in e-commerce, particularly for technology products requiring explanation. Research consistently demonstrates that video content increases engagement, comprehension, and purchase intent. For a $299 health monitoring device, consumers expect comprehensive visual demonstrations of features, functionality, and value proposition. The unavailable video represents a significant missed commercial opportunity, directly reducing conversion rates. Furthermore, it signals poor attention to detail, creating doubt about product quality and organizational competence. In competitive markets, this single issue may drive potential customers to competitors with more polished presentations.
Implementation Priority
These three recommendations should be acted on right away, with Recommendation 1 being the top priority because it carries the greatest legal risk. All of the issues can be fixed with a reasonable amount of development work, yet leaving them unresolved exposes the business to far greater consequences. Taken together, these changes would significantly strengthen legal compliance, ethical practices, professional quality, and overall commercial performance.
